            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>
                This <b>HTML5 Typescript Template</b> is a very basic set up of a page, minimalistic CSS, 
                and compiling Typescript with Webpack.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intention is to have a small base from which a project can be started, without
                the hassle of creating this boilerplate code everytime.
            </p>
          </section>

            <h1>How to use it?</h1>
            <p>
                It has been set up to be used as easily as possible.
                Use the following steps to get started:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone it from Github with <code>git clone ..address..</code>, or download the release as a .zip.</li>
                <li>You need to have Node JS installed for <code>npm</code>.</li>
                <li>Restore all the packages with <code>npm i</code>.</li>
                <li>Compile it with <code>webpack</code>.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>What does it include?</h1>
            <p>
                This template already inclused the following things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open Sans font from <a href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">Google Fonts</a>.</li>
                <li>A basic color palette created with <a href="https://coolors.co/541388-d90368-f1e9da-2e294e-ffd400">coolors.co</a>.</li>
                <li>Complete CSS reset.</li>
                <li>A basic 'holy grail' layout with flexbox.</li>
                <li>CSS overrides for dark mode.</li>
                <li>An empty CSS media query rule, to start with making everything responsive.</li>
                <li>Set up for Typescript with <code>strict</code> mode.</li>
                <li>Set up for Webpack to start building.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is supposed to be a very light boilerplate template, without any CSS framework, or other UI/JS frameworks.
                These should be added yourself, if required.
